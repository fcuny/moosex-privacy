NAME
    MooseX::Privacy - Provides the syntax to restrict/control visibility of
    your methods

SYNOPSIS
      use MooseX::Privacy;

      private _foo => sub {
        return 23;
      };

      protected _bar => sub {
        return 42;
      };

DESCRIPTION
    MooseX::Privacy brings the concept of private and protected methods to
    your class.

  Private
    When you declare a method as private, this method can be called only
    within the class.

        package Foo;
        use Moose;
        use MooseX::Privacy;
        private _foo => sub { return 23 };
        sub foo { my $self = shift; $self->_foo }
        1;

        my $foo = Foo->new;
        $foo->_foo; # die
        $foo->foo;  # ok

  Protected
    When you declare a method as protected, this method can be called only
    within the class AND any of it's subclasses.

        package Foo;
        use Moose;
        use MooseX::Privacy;
        protected _foo => sub { return 23 };

        package Bar;
        use Moose;
        extends Foo;
        sub foo { my $self = shift; $self->_foo }
        1;

        my $foo = Foo->new;
        $foo->_foo; # die
        my $bar = Bar->new;
        $bar->foo;  # ok
